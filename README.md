# me

This is the code for my personal website and resume. The main branch of this repository is reflected on https://nsood.in.

## Cool things that I never get to brag about

* The header section of the website always correctly indicates my age, as long as you have JavaScript enabled. It will calculate and display my age based on my most recent birthday.
* There is a dark mode in this website, accessible by typing `clapoff`. Light mode can be restored by typing `clapon`.
* I spent a decent amount of time worrying about accessibility in the later iterations of this website, so hopefully that should not be an issue for anyone. If there's anything I can do to improve on that front, please let me know.

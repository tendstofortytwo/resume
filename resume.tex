{Software Engineering Intern, Infrastructure -- Kitchener, ON}
{
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
    \item Reduced Docker image build times by 10x by simplifying package requirements and allowing precompiled dependencies.

Made Tailscale ready for the cloud, by creating features that allowed it to run in lightweight, unprivileged container environments. This included a virtual networking stack for connecting to the Tailscale network without kernel privileges to create a network driver, a SOCKS5 proxy to allow applications to communicate over this virtual networking stack, and ephemeral authentication keys for stateless access to the Tailscale network. Also published long-form technical content on company blog (https://tailscale.com/blog/2021-05-github-actions-and-tailscale/) and contributed to product knowledge base.

{\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
    \item Improved compatibility with LXC containers by providing in-process TCP/IP and link-layer emulation, using Google gVisor.
    \item Enabled standardized communication using SOCKS5 protocol over Tailscale VPN by implementing proxy server in Go.
    \item Simplified deployments in cloud environments by creating single-session authentication keys with auto-cleanup.
    \item Enabled clients to secure CI/CD pipelines by creating a GitHub Action (\underline{\href{https://github.com/tailscale/github-action}{link}}) that allows workflows to use Tailscale VPN. % can say CI/CD here
    \item Expanded outreach within technical community by writing long-form content for knowledge base and corporate blog (\underline{\href{https://tailscale.com/blog/2021-05-github-actions-and-tailscale/}{link}}).

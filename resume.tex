\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
    \item Designed distributed gRPC logging system using Apache Fluent for \textbf{scalable auditing and compliance} across organization.
    \item Created proof-of-concept for logging system using Kubernetes DaemonSets, with ConfigMaps to deploy custom configurations.
    \item Enforced standardization of Protobuf definitions for \textbf{over 300 microservices} by designing static analysis tool in Go.
    \item \textbf{Optimized build times by 10x} for Docker images by simplifying package requirements to allow precompiled dependencies.
    \item Improved system availability by identifying and removing bottlenecks in Redis server connections in Python library.

% long form description for job applications
Made Tailscale ready for the cloud, by creating features that allowed it to run in lightweight, unprivileged container environments. This included a virtual networking stack for connecting to the Tailscale network without kernel privileges to create a network driver, a SOCKS5 proxy to allow applications to communicate over this virtual networking stack, and ephemeral authentication keys for stateless access to the Tailscale network. Also published long-form technical content on company blog (https://tailscale.com/blog/2021-05-github-actions-and-tailscale/) and contributed to product knowledge base.

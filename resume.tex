Made Tailscale ready for the cloud, by creating features that allowed it to run in lightweight, unprivileged container environments. This included a virtual networking stack for connecting to the Tailscale network without kernel privileges to create a network driver, a SOCKS5 proxy to allow applications to communicate over this virtual networking stack, and ephemeral authentication keys for stateless access to the Tailscale network. Also published long-form technical content on company blog (https://tailscale.com/blog/2021-05-github-actions-and-tailscale/) and contributed to product knowledge base.

{\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
    \item Boosted compatibility with LXC containers by providing in-process TCP/IP and link-layer emulation, using Google gVisor.
    \item Enabled simple, standard communication for programs over Tailscale network by creating a SOCKS5 proxy server in Go.
    \item Simplified deployment of Tailscale in cloud environments by creating single-session authentication keys with auto-cleanup.
    \item Secured continuous integration and deployment pipelines by creating GitHub Action to allow workflows to use Tailscale.
    \item Expanded outreach with technical community by writing long-form content for knowledge base and corporate blog (\underline{\href{https://tailscale.com/blog/2021-05-github-actions-and-tailscale/}{link}}).
